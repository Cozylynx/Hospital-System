# Hospital System

Welcome to the Hospital System repository! This project implements a simple system where patients can be added to different specializations, and the doctor can call the next patient based on specialization.

## Features

- Add new patients to regular or urgent queues.
- Print the list of patients for each specialization.
- Get the next patient to see the doctor.

## How to Use

1. **Compile and Run:**
   - Compile the `hospital_system.cpp` file using your preferred C++ compiler.
   - Run the compiled executable.

2. **Menu Options:**
   - Choose from the following options:
     - **1) Add new patient:** Input specialization, name, and status (0 for regular, 1 for urgent).
     - **2) Print all patients:** Display the list of patients for each specialization.
     - **3) Get next patient:** Call the next patient for the doctor.
     - **4) Exit:** Terminate the program.

3. **Sample Interaction:**

Certainly! Below is a simple README template to explain your hospital system on GitHub. Feel free to modify and expand upon it according to your preferences:

This is a sample project I made while learning C++ from Mostafa Saad Ibrahim in the course named "Mastering 4 critical skills using C++17"
